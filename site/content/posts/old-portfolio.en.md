# A little history...

To begin, I finished my CEGEP in 2017 ... My last class, a course where we have to
create a group project, did not happen as planned. We had to learn a bit of PHP Laravel. 

It was the first time I used a free _framework_ to do a school project.
I had just installed my first GNU/ inux distribution on my laptop,
and I liked the idea of ​​managing my project by the CLI.

Once the course ended (and with my college diploma in hand), I decided to continue using
Laravel to make my own website.

# The website

After a few days of _headaches_, I created a functional website. It was a "complete" CMS,
with the possibility of creating projects and chapters to explain _lots, lots of things_.
Obviously, I put the website online, added my first project "Portfolio" and forgot to put it
up to date for several months. Indeed, the CMS I had created was not easy to use, so I
I did not want to keep it up to date.

The website has been put online, somewhere in the cloud.

Unfortunately, it is no longer online ..
