# Who am I?

![Me](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/25652765?s=460&v=4) 

Roch D'Amour, admirer of free software and automation. I realized some cool projects
in my spare time, and I have accumulated several contributions to some free projects over time.

I mostly spend my time exploring new technology, writing configurations files or figuring out
how to be lazy and save time in the near future. Being lazy is a skill: It forces you to automate the boring
stuff.

### What I do

Currently, I am a student in Software Engineering at ÉTS. Also, I'm involved in a free software club,
[CEDILLE](http://cedille.etsmtl.ca/), which I became captain of after several semesters.
